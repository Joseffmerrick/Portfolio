                Since 2019 I have been studying JavaScript and React while looking for employment in an Agile environment.

                I began my journey by attending Full Sail University's online Video Game Design 
                program where I learned C#, and practiced video game development in Unity. After graduating in 2017, 
                earning a Bachelors degree of Science, I studied JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my spare time.

                When I was met with competition in my job search, I decided to update my skills set and get training in full stack 
                development by attending We Can Code IT, in the fall of 2019. I graduated December 11th, 2019 with a
                certification in Software Development.
